# Semantic Memory Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation progress of the Semantic Memory feature. Semantic memory enables agents to store, retrieve, and search information based on semantic meaning rather than exact matches.

## Current Status

As of July 2025, the semantic memory feature is **partially implemented** with foundational components in place.

### Completed Components

- ✅ Vector Storage Interface (`VectorStoreProtocol` in `vector.py`)
- ✅ In-Memory Vector Implementation (`InMemoryVectorStore`)
- ✅ Basic Vector Memory Backend (`VectorMemoryBackend`)
- ✅ Embedding Provider Protocol (`EmbeddingProviderProtocol`)
- ✅ Mock Embedding Provider for Testing

### In Progress Components

- 🔄 Redis Vector Implementation (basic implementation exists but lacks true vector search)

### Pending Components

- 📝 Full Redis Vector Store with RediSearch
- 📝 Additional Vector Stores (Pinecone, Chroma)
- 📝 Semantic Memory Manager
- 📝 Agent Integration (decorator options, configuration)
- 📝 Context Summarization
- 📝 Automatic Memory Prioritization

## Implementation Plan

Following the original RFC plan with updated timelines:

### Phase 1: Complete Vector Store Implementations (Estimated: 3 weeks)

- Enhance Redis implementation with proper RediSearch vector capabilities
- Add Pinecone vector store implementation
- Add Chroma vector store implementation
- Comprehensive testing suite for vector operations

### Phase 2: Memory Manager and Embedding (Estimated: 2 weeks)

- Implement `SemanticMemoryManager` class
- Add production-ready embedding generation
- Configure multiple embedding model options
- Add utilities for batched embedding generation

### Phase 3: Agent Integration (Estimated: 2 weeks)

- Update `@Agent` decorator with semantic memory options
- Implement configuration system for semantic memory
- Add memory-related tools to BaseAgent
- Create examples demonstrating semantic memory usage

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Estimated: 3 weeks)

- Implement automatic context summarization
- Add memory prioritization logic
- Create conversation history management with semantic filtering
- Add memory persistence and session management

## Documentation Plan

- Add semantic memory concepts guide
- Create API documentation for memory interfaces
- Develop cookbook examples for common memory patterns
- Add performance optimization guide for large memory stores
